# Typst Resume Template

A simple resume template for [typst.app](https://typst.app/).

Aesthetic style inspired by the [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) project.

This is not a perfect clone, the main purpose of this project is to explore and experiment with Typst's typography features.
